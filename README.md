# E-Commerce Website

---

Welcome to the *HydroHomies* webshop, Denmark's No. 1 online store for carefully curated craft waters and everything else you need to stay hydrated!

---

This is our group project for the course *Frameworks and Architectures of the Web* at the IT University of Copenhagen.

This is the first iteration of the project, developed using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Subsequent versions will include a backend service built using Node.js and Express.js, and a new frontend client built using React and TypeScript.

The website can be accessed using the following link:

The current iteration of the project consists of the following pages:
- __Landing page__ (`index.html`): homepage of the webshop with the available categories and a selection of products displayed
- __Products page__ (`all_products.html`): displaying all our products with different options to filter them
- __Individual product page__ (`single_product.html`): dynamically generated to display the description and the properties of a selected product
- __Shopping cart__ (`shopping_cart.html`): summarizing the items and their quantites in the user's cart
- __Registration page__ (`register.html`) and __Login page__ (`login.html`): simple forms accepting and locally storing the user's details
- __Profile page__ (`profile.html`): displays and enables the modification of user information
